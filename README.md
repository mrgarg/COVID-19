# COVID-19
## A small learning project to build a COVID-19 detector using CNN in Keras

- Dataset for COVID-19 Positive cases can be found [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).
- Dataset for Negative cases can be found [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
- The folder Dataset in the repo is the output of Dataset_Creater.ipynb Notebook.
- The Dataset_Creater.ipynb notebook preprocess the datasets of COVID Positive and Negative cases to generate the final Dataset for our model.
- The Dataset folder is then finally divided in training and validation sets and uploaded at this dropbox [link](http://cb.lk/covid_19).
- COVID_19_Detector.ipynb Notebook is our CNN based detector which gives a accuracy of nearly 96%.
